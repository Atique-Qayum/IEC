# Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering.
## How do you select data?

- Consider what data you actually need to address the question or problem you are working on. Questions to help think:
1 - What is the extent of the data you have available?
2 - What data is not available that you wish you had available?
3 - What data don't you need to address the problem?

### Better data > Fancier algorithms
- Formatting: selected data may not be in a suitable format
- Cleaning: Removal or fixing of missing data
- Sampling: More selected data availabel then needed

----

## Dummy Variables

- Transforming categorical attribute to numerical attribute
- Each attribute will have value either 0 or 1
- full Dummy variables:
- Dummy variables with reference group:
- Dummy variables for ordered categorical variable with refernce group:

## Transform Data

## Transformed attributes :  Box-Cox

# How to Handle missing data?
- no good way to deal with missing data!
- Different solutions for data imputation depending on the kind of problem.

## Data imputation 
- Mean / Median
- Zero / Constant values (most frequent)
- k-NN (k nearest neighbours is an algroithm that is used)
- Multivariate imputation (filling the missind data multiple times)
- Data Reduction (Feature selection, Instance selection, Discretization)
- Prinipal Component analysis
- Correlation
- Transform Data (Scaling, Decomposition, Aggregation)
- standardization (variance scaling) Resulting scaled feature has a mean of 0 and a variace of 1
