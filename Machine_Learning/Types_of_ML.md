## Types of Machine Learning 📚

| Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Supervised Learning     | Learns from labeled data where inputs are mapped to corresponding outputs. Common tasks include classification and regression.                                        |
| Unsupervised Learning   | Learns from unlabeled data to discover patterns or structures within the data. Common tasks include clustering and dimensionality reduction.                        |
| Semi-Supervised Learning| Uses both labeled and unlabeled data for training. It aims to leverage the benefits of labeled data while utilizing the abundance of unlabeled data.                   |
| Reinforcement Learning  | Involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.                              |
| Self-Supervised Learning| Utilizes unsupervised learning techniques where the model generates its own labels from the input data. Commonly achieved through pretext tasks.                      |
| Genetic Algorithms      | Optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection. They iteratively improve solutions by mimicking the process of evolution, including selection, crossover, and mutation. |
